The rise of automation, cloud computing, and AI improved software performance and adaptability.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1️. Planning – Define project scope, goals, and feasibility.
2️.Requirements Analysis – Gather and document user and system requirements.
3️. Design – Create architecture,  and technical specifications.
4️.Implementation (Coding) – Developers write and test the code.
5️. Testing – Identify and fix bugs through various testing methods.
6️. Deployment – Release the software for users (beta or full launch).
7️. Maintenance & Updates – Fix issues, improve features, and ensure security.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies
1️. Approach:

Waterfall follows a linear and sequential process, where each phase is completed before moving to the next.
Agile is iterative and flexible, allowing for continuous changes and improvements throughout development.
2️. Phases:

Waterfall strictly follows predefined phases: Planning, Design, Development, Testing, and Deployment, without revisiting previous steps.
Agile divides the project into smaller cycles (sprints) where design, development, and testing happen simultaneously.
3️. Flexibility:

Waterfall is rigid, making it difficult to modify requirements once the project has started.
Agile is highly adaptable, allowing changes and feedback at any stage.
4️.Customer Involvement:

Waterfall has limited customer interaction, with feedback collected only at the end.
Agile involves customers continuously, with frequent feedback and adjustments.
5️.Delivery:

Waterfall delivers a single final release after full development.
Agile delivers incremental releases with new features in short iterations.
When to Use Each Methodology
* Waterfall is suitable for:

Government projects that require strict regulations and fixed requirements.
Banking and financial systems where security and stability are critical.
Construction software that needs clear planning before execution.
* Agile is suitable for:

Mobile app development where frequent updates and user feedback are needed.
E-commerce websites that require constant changes in features and design.
Startups and SaaS platforms that need rapid iteration and continuous improvements.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1️. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
Importance:

Provides a complete toolkit for coding, debugging, and testing in one place.
Increases productivity with features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging tools.
Helps manage large projects efficiently with built-in support for multiple programming languages.
Examples of IDEs:

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – Lightweight and supports multiple extensions.
PyCharm – Best for Python development with intelligent coding features.
Eclipse – Popular for Java development.
IntelliJ IDEA – Advanced IDE for Java and Kotlin developers.
2️. Version Control Systems (VCS)
Importance:

Tracks changes in the code, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.
Enables collaboration among multiple developers working on the same project.
Prevents code conflicts and data loss by maintaining different versions of the project.
Examples of VCS:

Git – Most widely used, supports distributed version control (commonly used with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket).
SVN (Subversion) – Centralized version control system used in legacy projects.
Mercurial – Another distributed VCS, similar to Git but with a simpler workflow.
Why They Matter Together:
Using an IDE with a VCS (e.g., VS Code + Git) improves development efficiency, ensures code safety, and enhances teamwork.
